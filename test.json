Shinde (25), a job seeker, is from Zari Budruk village in Chakur tehsil in the district of Latur. Sarode clarified that although Amol’s actions were wrong, the circumstances that made him do this need to be heard. “I believe that Amol Shinde and others involved in entering the Parliament and using smoke canisters have done wrong as the Parliament is a symbol of pride and elected members across India sit there.. they should be punished for that but the law provisions being charged against them are wrong I feel, that’s why I’ll stand with Amol Shinde and help him in legal aid,” Sarode said while talking to media. #WATCH | Mumbai: Advocate Asim Sarode says, \"I believe that Amol Shinde and others involved in entering the Parliament and using smoke canisters have done wrong as the Parliament is a symbol of pride and elected members across India sit there…they should be punished for that… pic.twitter.com/znmIxfui9M — ANI (@ANI) December 15, 2023 “I will see whether the charges under the FIR are right or not…What Amol Shinde and others tried to bring forward is the issue of unemployment and inflation,” he added. Amol’s mother Kesarbai and father Dhanraj Shinde meanwhile stated in Latur that they had no idea what had gone wrong. Santosh and Rahul, his brothers, are equally clueless. However, Amol’s parents acknowledged experiencing financial strain. “He wanted to go to Latur for further studies for preparations (for recruitment in armed forces and police). However, we were not able to support him financially,” they said. It is important to note that Advocate Asim Sarode who has extended legal aid to the accused who jumped into the Parliament on 13th December and smoke-attacked the ongoing Parliament session, has been an ardent supporter of Congress and its leader Rahul Gandhi. He had earlier participated in the Bharat Jodo Yatra and had showered praises for Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. “Uniting people is very difficult but dividing them is easy…. Rahul Gandhi talks about uniting hearts, he talks about uniting India… We love India and that is why we are with Rahul Gandhi!” he said as he shared a video of his participation in the Bharat Jodo Yatra with Rahul Gandhi. जोडना बहोत मुश्किल और तोडना आसान होता है…. राहुल गांधी मनोको जोडने की बात करते है, भारत जोडने की बात करते है….. हमारा भारत देश पे प्यार है और इसलीये हम राहुल गांधी के साथ है! #भारतजोडोयात्रा #राहुलगांधी @varungandhi80 @RahulGandhi #asimsarode pic.twitter.com/fncp9tTybT — Asim Sarode (@AsimSarode) January 6, 2023 Notably, he had also extended his support to Gandhi when he was reinstated in the Parliament as the Wayanad MP after the Supreme Court’s relief in the Modi surname defamation case. “The parliament will see the high voltage discussions around valid questions again as a man with democratic values Rahul Gandhi will be back in action. If he is a ‘pappu’ then let the ‘pappa’ show the courage to remain present in the Parliament and answer the questions being raised by him,” Sarode was quoted as saying. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Asim Sarode (@asim_sarode) Further, when CM Eknath Shinde and 39 other MLAs ‘rebelled’ against the then-MVA government, seven citizens filed a PIL demanding action against Shinde and other rebel MLAs saying that they had caused political turmoil and instigated internal disorder. Advocate Asim Sarode who was representing the seven citizens was slammed by the Bombay High Court for filing ‘an absolutely politically induced litigation.’ The petitioners were fined Rs 1 lakh while the court said Prima facie, “We are of the view that this is a politically induced litigation. The petitioners have not made requisite research. We direct the petitioners to deposit Rs 1 lakh as security within two weeks.” Also in the year 2021 whenIndia was facing the second wave of COVID-19, Sarode had made anti-Hindu statements targeting the organization of the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar. Sarode made statements targeting the Hindu community and said that the Kumb Mela would escalate the spread of Corona virus. Reportedly, Hindus then happened to counter the statements made by Sarode saying that Kumbh Mela was an age-old tradition and an old religious practice. To this, Sarode had raged controversy saying that it was Akbar who began the Kumbh Mela and that he was the first one to take the religious bath so it was called ‘Shahi Snan’. Meanwhile, it has also come to the fore that Sarode has connections with Teesta Setalvad, a controversial ‘activist’ Teesta Setalvad, who is known for the fabrication of evidence in cases concerning the 2002 Gujarat riots. “Adv Asim Sarode, (offering to defend those involved in the breach), an active participant in Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra is also associated with Teesta Setalwad,” BJP spokesperson Suresh Nakhua said on X. Teesta Setalwad link emerges to the breach of Parliament security !!! Adv Asim Sarode, (offering to defend those involved in the breach), an active participant in Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra is also associated with Teesta Setalwad. pic.twitter.com/dweLGbrYQE — Suresh Nakhua (सुरेश नाखुआ) 🇮🇳 (@SureshNakhua) December 15, 2023 As reported earlier, on December 13th, in a major security breach in the Parliament, two men jumped into the Lok Sabha well from the visitors’ gallery while the proceedings were ongoing. A video from the Lok Sabha showed the members of Parliament assaulting one of the two perpetrators who burst into the chamber during proceedings and tossed canisters emitting yellow smoke. The MPs could also be seen plucking the hair of the intruder, hurling shoes at him, and landing punches at him before encircling him. In the latest update to the case, the Delhi Police on Thursday (14th December) arrested all four accused who launched a smoke attack in the Parliament. According to the Delhi Police, the accused persons had purchased special shoes from Lucknow and canisters from Mumbai. This was a well-planned conspiracy and attack on the Parliament of India. Police lawyers further submitted that the accused carried a pamphlet and declared Prime Minister Modi as a missing person and said the person who found him would be paid with money from the Swiss Bank. The accused persons showed the Prime Minister like a proclaimed offender. Police informed the court that it had registered the FIR under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and had also added sections of stringent 16 (terrorism) and 18 (conspiracy for terrorism) of the UAPA Act. Meanwhile, police sources on Thursday (14th December) said the four persons arrested in connection with the security breach in Parliament have taken common responsibility for the incident, adding that they were giving “rote answers” to the investigation team of the Delhi Police Special Cell in the matter.

After posting a mammoth total of 428 runs batting first, India skittled England for just 136 runs eking out a massive lead of 292 runs in the first innings. England's all of top six batters entered double-digit scores but apart from Nat Sciver-Brunt, none could score big. Tammy Beaumont was expected to make an impact for the visitors but 's excellent fielding skills and accurate throw cut short her stay in the middle. The incident happened in the 19th over of the innings when Sciver-Brunt just tapped the delivery from Rajeshwari Gayakwad on to the leg-side and set off for a single. Beaumont also responded to her quickly but Vastrakar was even quicker to pick up the ball and fire a throw. The ball directly smashed into the stumps and despite putting in a dive, Beaumont fell short of her crease much to the delight of the Indian players. It was a sensational effort in the field as India got a lucky break and England, from here on, were in tatters. Meanwhile, starred for India with the ball picking up a stunning five-wicket haul in just 5.3 overs conceding just 7 runs. She created a record of regsitering a fifer in fewest overs bowled in a Women's Test in history bettering a 38-year-old effort from India's Gargi Banerjee. As for the match, India surprisingly didn't enforce a follow-on, on England and have decided to bat again in the second innings. With a 292-run lead in the first innings, it remains to be seen if the hosts bat the visitors out of the game.",

Aditi plays the character of Ethel Muggs in the teen musical drama. She is the daughter of actress Shena Gamat, who has worked in ‘Band Baaja Baraat’. Her father Amit Saigal was an Indian rock musician, and was fondly called ‘Papa Rock’. The diva graced the stage of quiz-based reality show ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati 15’, along with the director Zoya Akhtar and other star cast Agastya Nanda, Suhana Khan, Khushi Kapoor, Vedang Raina, Mihir Ahuja, and Yuvraj Menda. During the conversation, host and megastar Amitabh Bachchan asked her: “Why are you called Dot? Dot means a point. Is Dot your real name?” The young actress said: “Yes. Actually, my real name is Aditi Saigal. But I chose a stage name for myself when I was just 9-10 years old. l used to fill colouring books along with my mother.” Calling herself a perfectionist, Aditi went on to say: “So I liked to colour within the margins but my mom was fond of making dots outside the margin.

            "content": "New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday refused to stay an Allahabad High Court order that allowed a primary survey of the Shahi Idgah mosque complex adjacent to the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi Temple in Uttar Pradesh’s Mathura. Hindu outfits have claimed the mosque was built on the birthplace of Lord Krishna and have demanded a survey. The demand was admitted by a local court in December last year but the Muslim side had filed an objection in the High Court. “The Supreme Court has refused to stay the proceedings and has fixed the matter so far as challenge to the transfer order is concerned on 9th of January…The High Court order will continue and the High Court will proceed with the matter and there is no stay by the Supreme Court,” Vishnu Shankar Jain, the lawyer for the Hindu side said, NDTV reported. On Wednesday, the Allahabad High Court allowed the primary survey of the Idgah complex by a court-monitored three-member team of advocate commissioners. The court on Thursday appointed an advocate commissioner and gave in-principle approval for surveying the Shahi Idgah complex. The modalities of the Commission of advocates for the survey will be decided on December 18. Earlier, Ranjana Agnihotri, a resident of Lucknow had filed a suit demanding the ownership of 13.37 acres of land of Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi. In her legal suit, Agnihotri demanded to remove the Shahi Idgah mosque built in Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi. The suit filed in the Mathura court has sought the removal of a mosque said to have been built in 1669-70 on the orders of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in the 13.37-acre premises of Katra Keshav Dev temple near the birthplace of Lord Krishna. The Muslim side had earlier sought to dismiss the petition by citing the Places of Worship Act of 1991, which maintains the religious status of any place of worship as it was on August 15, 1947. Notably, there are a total of 18 cases in the High Court concerning the Krishna Janmabhoomi-Shahi Masjid dispute, after the court transferred to itself all pending suits before the local court in Mathura.

The match went right down to the wire after the hosts suffered a collapse but significant contributions from the lower order helped them get over the line by the barest of margins. Chasing a mediocre total of 221 to win, the White Ferns looked in a spot of bother as they were reduced to 13/2 with Amelia Kerr and skipper Sophie Devine back in the hutch. However, a century stand between former captain Suzie Bates and Maddy Green snatched the momentum from Pakistan's corner and put the home team in the driver's seat. Leg-break bowler Ghulam Fatima provided the visitors with the much-needed breakthrough when she got rid of Bates in the 32nd over. The 28-year-old leggie dented the White Ferns again in the 36th over when she removed Green to throw the game wide open. A batting collapse of a major scale saw the Sophie Devine-led side go from 155/3 to 198/8. With Pakistan bowlers having their tails up, New Zealand needed their bowlers to step up with the willow in hand and Lea Tahuhu and company did the same. Tahuhu (21* off 26 balls) batted sensibly and helped her side get over the line in the penultimate over of the game. Earlier in the day, stand-in skipper Fatima Sana dazzled with the bat in hand and played arguably the greatest knock (90* off 104 balls) of her ODI career to script a rescue act of the highest order. Her valiant knock propelled Pakistan to 220 with useful contributions coming from Natalia Pervaiz (39 off 73 balls) and Najiha Alvi (32 off 38 balls). Meanwhile, the third ODI of the series will be played on Monday, December 18 at the same venue.",

They’ve kept them relevant by continually reinventing their look, purpose, and status. Some of these pieces have not only built the brand but have also served as a source of inspiration for many of us to strive for personal growth and one day be able to afford them. Let’s have a look at how these iconic pieces have evolved over the years. I recently bumped into a friend who works at Burberry, and she kindly invited me to the store. There, I encountered the most iconic outerwear hanging on a separate wall. It was my inaugural experience donning it, and boy, was it heavy. Featuring an oversized fit and reversibility, the Burberry trench from the Fall/Winter 2023 collection exuded more glam than its military predecessor. Originally popularized during World War I, the trench coat gained further fame through cinematic gems like “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” and “Casablanca,” where it was romanticized. What allowed the trench coat to endure even through wars? Its versatility. Whether draped over a basic T-shirt and denim or elegantly layered onto your red carpet ensemble, the trench coat seamlessly adapts to various styles. While the design elements of the trench coat evolved with the trends of the 1960s and 1970s, its classic features remained unwavering. When Daniel Lee, Burberry’s former creative director, opened his debut collection with an oversized trench coat adorned with fur trims, it symbolized the paramount significance of this piece for the brand and the fashion world. Mr. Aldo Gucci’s trip to New York in 1953 is hailed as one of the most successful journeys in fashion history because, as a souvenir, he bestowed upon us the iconic Gucci Horsebit Loafer. Gucci commemorates 70 years of this legendary shoe this year, a timeless exemplar of impeccable craftsmanship. Throughout the years, various creative directors have showcased their ingenuity at Gucci, but it was Alessandro Michele who played a pivotal role in rejuvenating and evolving the brand’s aesthetic, particularly the iconic horsebit loafer. Crafted in a variety of materials, including leather, suede, and exotic skins, the horsebit loafers have stood the test of time. Gucci has consistently experimented with different finishes, such as patent leather or distressed leather, bestowing the loafers with a contemporary and diverse allure. At Gucci’s SS2024 show, models graced the runway, flaunting an array of horsebit loafer styles. From mules and platform heels to slippers and more, the collection showcased the enduring versatility and innovation of this iconic footwear, If you have even the slightest interest in fashion, the mention of Tod’s will likely evoke thoughts of classic loafers. Additionally, the Gommino is another notable shoe inspired by the city of New York. However, what propelled the Gommino to fame? Was it the quality leather or the vivid colors? No, it’s the distinctive rubber nubs, 133 to be precise, beneath the sole. The Gommino also boasts a lace detail and an iconic Double T metal clamp. From Harrison Ford to Princess Diana, the Gommino is a favorite for a casual and timeless look. Do you know that every Tod’s shoe is handmade? Well, now you know why are they so iconic. The first time I laid eyes on this iconic bag was in “Sex and the City” where Sarah Jessica Parker effortlessly sported one. Originally crafted in 1999 by the visionary John Galliano, the Dior Saddle Bag swiftly became the ‘IT’ girls’ must-have accessory. Galliano’s genius shone through as he conceptualized this bag at the turn of the century, a time when fashionistas were opening themselves to experimentation. Consequently, this spunky-shaped bag became an overnight sensation. In 2018, Maria Grazia Chiuri took the reins and reintroduced the Saddle Bag in various captivating versions. Today, the Saddle Bag has evolved into a versatile piece that can be worn as a messenger bag and is even available in designs tailored for men. Nevertheless, the original designs from its inception have now achieved coveted ‘vintage status.’ These timeless pieces continue to carry the allure making them not just accessories but cherished fashion artifacts. It wouldn’t be inaccurate to assert that Louis Vuitton has forever altered the landscape of travel. Once considered primarily utilitarian, trunks have transformed into status symbols under the influence of Louis Vuitton. The inception of the trunk dates back to 1854, but it truly gained iconic status in 1896 with the introduction of its distinctive monogram. Since then, the LV trunk has solidified its place as a fashion icon. Throughout the years, the trunk has experienced a resurgence in various forms and sizes, evolving from a mere clutch to a functional bar – akin to a fashion world’s ‘Ditto’ (Pokemon). In 2023, Louis Vuitton’s innovative creative director, Pharrell Williams, showcased these trunks in a unique manner: stacked on a golf cart. This presentation underscored their enduring importance and relevance in the contemporary fashion landscape. While initially crafted to accommodate the belongings of the elite, today, these trunks carry not only the brand’s heritage but also a substantial portion of fashion history. Louis Vuitton’s trunks, once practical vessels, have metamorphosed into timeless symbols of luxury and style.",

            "content": "Database management and cloud services company Oracle, which entered India nearly three decades ago, is witnessing strong growth in its cloud business in the country. This is driven by digital innovation in the BFSI sector, small and medium businesses, and public sector initiatives. Given the strong growth prospects in India, Garrett Ilg, 62, Executive Vice President of Oracle Japan and Asia Pacific—in an exclusive interaction with Business Today’s Nidhi Singal—talks about the role the country plays in its global operations, skilling employees, the impact of macroeconomic headwinds, adoption of new-age technologies such as generative AI, and more. Edited excerpts: A: Japan and Asia Pacific is a very broad region for Oracle. All facilities available to our customers worldwide are available in this region, from the cloud, the database, the applications, the analytics, what we do in our hardware and systems business, all the way up to consulting. It’s an exciting region, it’s a dynamic region, but it’s [also] a very diverse region. And one of the things that we’re very careful about is being global but acting local, and working with our customers in the form that they need to be worked with, so we can help them be more competitive. We have been in Asia for decades. Our strong employee base of 50,000-plus professionals, with our partners, are laser-focussed on making sure our 90,000-plus customers have all the support they need to help them be successful. A: India is scaling faster than almost anywhere on the planet. Its transaction rate on the stock exchange, its payments system that it has built so that it can do micropayments, the amount of data moving through the infrastructure of Indian companies—both domestically and around the world—are at levels that the world’s never seen before. We’re very fortunate to have the opportunity to support our customers—whether they’re banks or airlines or auto manufacturers or services companies—and helping them work through and better their organisations so they can take advantage and/or create opportunities to better support their customers. Our Indian customers are technologically very advanced. They understand the value of a platform, they understand the value of an integrated solution. They also understand the challenges of a dynamic market. India is growing fast, both in [terms of the] size of the economy, [and] its transaction rate [that] sits on top of technology. Our Indian customers are really pushing the limits of scaleability, on how integration works, and the functionality of application infrastructure. For Oracle, we see that as a challenge, but we also see that as an opportunity. India is a dynamic market, and if you ask about fitting in, they’re helping us and teaching us to innovate, because we listen to our customers. By working with them, we get better ideas, we go to market together and we help them solve problems for their customers, which quite frankly, aren’t mostly unique to India, they’re global. So, by working, focussing, and then executing in India, it benefits Oracle, both in India and of course our customers around the world and most importantly, we help our Indian customers satisfy the needs of scaleability, affordability and security. A: Oracle’s primary growth strategy is to be One Oracle. We’re the only company in technology that has the database, which is the data, which is a very essential component of any technology strategy; the application layer, which utilises the data to deliver outcomes; the ability to do analytics across that data; drive that with AI automation across the entire platform; and then have systems infrastructure—all built on a Generation 2 cloud, the most advanced cloud architecture in the market; and Oracle brings that to our customers as a platform. That platform is gaining recognition in the market regardless of the vertical. A: I think the macroeconomics in this region are pretty substantial, pushing our business along in countries like India, Singapore, and across the Asean. And I think one of the things that we’re doing is we’re working with our customers to help them take advantage of this opportunity, a global opportunity. But again, being local, because each economy, each culture, has its own challenges. One of the things that Oracle really does focus on is making sure we help our customers with the outcome in their business, not just providing technology, but helping them to use it so they can deliver a better experience for their customers and better outcomes for their business. A: Security has always been a very important point of focus for Oracle. It has been since the beginning of this company, and that is really our heritage. We’ve taken it through our database and the infrastructure to manage data all the way through the applications layer. We’ve delivered Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Gen. 2, which is an always-on security infrastructure, and by that, I mean that developers and people who come in with applications infrastructure can’t turn it off. And that’s really a safety feature to enable our customers to know that they’re always protected by their infrastructure. And most importantly, the threats come from all directions now. Sometimes they’re external, but sometimes, even internal. There’s ransomware, there’s cyberattacks, there’s all kinds of things we don’t even know about that are going to hit our customers in the future. So, we have to be ready now, prepare for the future, defend them now, but also defend them in the future. And together with our customers and our partners, we’re building a very, very big focus on security. And it’s a security-first approach. A: Oracle’s been delivering AI, machine learning, [and] all these capabilities for quite a long time. We started with our autonomous infrastructure, which quite frankly doesn’t require human interaction... if you can put your data into a computer infrastructure and automate that, you can manage it, measure it, and then manage it again, so that you can continuously improve on that process. You can count on that to go correctly as you’ve programmed it. Not only our autonomous database technology, but we’ve got infrastructure for anomaly detection in our applications layer, we have trend analysis. We’ve all been talking about AI and that is being driven by data, and then the data is driven across an infrastructure by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. .. So, while we’ve been working with automation, working with AI, being out there, delivering that to our customers, we’re ready and set to go out there and help them take it to the next level. A: Oracle has over 45,000 people in India, and there’s all kinds of roles. There are field roles, there’s business support roles, consulting roles, development roles, product management roles. We have the full suite of employee expectation, experience, and staffing across our Indian business. And it’s not just the India market that we serve. There are many global responsibilities in our India team. Now that requires a lot of training, a lot of skill development and, of course, helping people future-proof themselves so that they can be ready for the next challenges. So, we have Oracle University, which conducts internal and external training programmes for employees and customers. We have job share, we have continued travel, and most importantly, we help people learn from each other and we share those experiences. So, while India becomes a business hub, it’s also a knowledge hub for Oracle. And we’re very excited because as we go into these new technologies like generative AI, as we continue to build on our autonomous capabilities—not just at the database level but in the cloud layer—we are able to offer a host of innovative products and solutions to our customers. As we see what comes next, we’re going to wrap our arms around that as One Oracle, as a team, as one business, and then work with our customers and partners to continue to innovate. That innovation comes out of learning and that learning is always going on in Oracle India. A: Sustainability is an important topic. And before I talk about what Oracle is doing, I’d like to qualify this in that it’s everybody’s role and responsibility on this planet and Oracle can be a part of that, but we certainly can’t do any of it alone. So, what we intend to do is by 2025, deliver zero emissions technology to our customers. We know that’s just part of the journey. We have to help them go into zero emissions and then become sustainable as a community. And that community is the business community, the verticals we work in, customers and partners, the buildings, the infrastructure, and the transportation layers. Oracle is working in all those verticals with the solutions we have, the technology that we deliver, and with that zero-emissions commitment that we have, to help the world and those people that we work with, to be better, sustainable citizens. Oracle will continue to push and drive with innovations on technology, on how we use infrastructure, electricity, water, repeatable solutions that can help not just our customers, but our customers’ customers become more sustainable. And that’s really what the world needs for sustainability.",

She was quoted saying, \"I asked her to be prepared as people are ready to shower you with hate. But not to forget herself in the process. I wish someone said this to me. I wish someone told me to try looking at the people who value you, like you because believing the bad is always easier.\" Janhvi also says that she and her sister at times question themselves giving all the social media talk that goes around. But she asked Khushi Kapoor 'Don’t lose yourself, don’t be jaded because you’ve been very honest.' In the interview, Janhvi Kapoor spoke at length about her mother Sridevi and the comparisons that come along.

But now she regrets it as she knows that Sridevi really wanted to be on the sets with her.",

News Reports Updated: 15 December, 2023 Bengaluru: Christian event ‘Pray for India’ by a foreign pastor cancelled over possible visa rule violations The event was called off as an activist pointed out that foreign nationals holding any kind of visa are not permitted to preach or spread their religion in India, according to Indian visa regulations. 15 December, 2023 OpIndia Staff He was set to speak at an event in Bengaluru. (Source: Instagram) Facebook Twitter Telegram Email WhatsApp 22 The author and popular televangelist from Johannesburg, South Africa Alph Lukau who is also known as an apostle of faith was scheduled to address a Christian religious event in Bengaluru termed ‘Pray for India-Conference 2023’ on 16th and 17th December from 4 pm to 9 pm. However, the program was called off as an activist pointed out that foreign nationals holding any kind of visa are not permitted to preach or spread their religion in India, according to Indian visa regulations. The post informing about the recent development stated, “We regret to announce, due to unexpected and unavoidable circumstances beyond all measure the Pray for India Conference 2023 to be held on 16th and 17th December at Palace Grounds Bengalurustands cancelled.” Pray for India cancelled! pic.twitter.com/FC2UlRy3Kv — Girish Bharadwaj (@Girishvhp) December 15, 2023 The organisers went so far as to petition the High Court to be allowed to hold the gathering and enable the foreign pastor to preach in defiance of the law, but Hindu activist Girish Bharadwaj also submitted an “intervening application” to enforce the statute. The organisers of Pray for India have approached the High Court with a prayer to permit them to conduct the event and permit the Foreign Pastor to preach which contravenes the law of the land. I will file an Intervening Application. https://t.co/uDjkTYBTNT — Girish Bharadwaj (@Girishvhp) December 15, 2023 A letter was submitted by Girish Bharadwaj to the Commissioner of Immigration and Foreigners Regional Registration Officer (FRRO), Bengaluru. It read that the aforementioned program set to happen on Palace Grounds, Gate No. 1, Krishna Vihar on the 16 and 17th of December was going to feature a talk by pastor Alph Lukau who is a South African national. The letter emphasised, “According to Indian Visa Norms, foreigners with any type of visa are not allowed to preach or propagate their religion in India and the rules do not permit the Indian Government to issue visas to evangelists who desire to come to India to attend religious campaign.” It accused that to obtain an Indian visa the pastor had deceived the Indian Consulate and added, “His travel to India is with the sole intention of evangelical conversions. I request you to kindly take the necessary precautions to prevent violation of Indian visa norms.” I have written letter to Commissioner Bureau of Immigration and FRRO, Bengaluru to Prevent Visa norms Violation pic.twitter.com/oD1cdF4bO2 — Girish Bharadwaj (@Girishvhp) December 10, 2023 The event was organised in association with Shalom and All India Christian Federation to “experience the power of faith” which was a subtle reference to belief in Christianity and Jesus Christ on the aforementioned dates. ‘ Resurrection stunt’ by the pastor A group of funeral directors in South Africa announced their intention to sue the preacher who claimed that he had brought a deceased man back to life in 2019. Pastor Alph Lukau was seen declaring “rise up” to a man who was lying down in a coffin in a viral video. The man then jerked upright to the delight of the worshippers. “Can you see what happened,” he asked during Sunday service and boasted, “This man died on Friday. He was in the mortuary. This is a sign that no matter what the devil’s done it is over. Devil, I told you wherever I find you I will kick you.” Three funeral homes decided to file lawsuits for reputational harm and alleged that they were tricked by the “scheme.” Local media outlets were informed by Kingdom Blue, Kings & Queens Funeral Services and Black Phoenix that church personnel had defrauded them in various ways. The church reportedly recanted its assertion of the man’s resurrection and confirmed that he was “already alive” when he was transported to the Kramerville grounds. Alleluia International Ministries stated that the Pastor had just “completed a miracle that God had already started.” The scene which was witnessed outside of Pastor Lukau’s church outside of Johannesburg drew criticism and jeers from many people. The footage spurred a national conversation about phoney pastors and was roundly criticised. Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities reacted, “There are no such things as miracles. They are made up to try to get money from the hopelessness of our people.” The self-styled prophet according to his website is the “founder and General Overseer of Alleluia Ministries International. He is a Bible Scholar and a renowned International Speaker who ministers on various platforms around the world. Through his ministry people are saved, healed, and delivered. We have seen families restored and many miracles take place.” It further added, “He is a coach, mentor, father and leader among leaders. As a spiritual father to many, he also submitted to the late pastor Jacques A Vernaud who was his spiritual father until his passing on 28 September 2011. Pastor Alph is also known for his passion for perfection in service delivery and continues to set the standard for excellence in ministry. He is also an accomplished businessman and is an icon in the marketplace.” His wife, the First Lady Celeste Lukau serves with him in the ministry. The preacher has over 1.5 million subscribers on YouTube and more than 6 million followers on his Facebook as well as Instagram accounts.

Mr. Sharma, a BJP state general secretary, took charge of the State on the day he turned 57. Along with him, Diya Kumari and Prem Chand Bairwa were sworn in as the Deputy Chief Ministers by Governor Kalraj Mishra. All three took the oath in Hindi. The outgoing Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot attended the ceremony held in front of the historic Albert Hall here. A large gathering of BJP MLAs and workers from across the state witnessed it. A Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-backed leader, Mr. Sharma was appointed the leader of the BJP legislature party on December 12. Top leaders attend The swearing-in ceremony was attended by PM Modi, BJP president J.P. Nadda, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and several other senior leaders of the party.

Seers and mahants from different places attended the ceremony as well. As Mr. Sharma, Ms. Kumari and Mr. Bairwa took the oath, BJP supporters raised slogans of 'Jai Shri Ram' and 'Modi-Modi'. Ashok Gehlot, who was among the leaders who reached the programme early, sat next to Gajendra Singh Shekhwat and was seen talking to him. Mr. Gehlot has been repeatedly targeting Union Minister Shekhawat, accusing him of being involved in the Sanjivani Credit Co-operative Society 'scam'. Mr. Shekhawat, in turn, has filed a defamation case against Mr. Gehlot in Delhi. Commotion Shortly before the oath ceremony, a brief commotion took place at an entry point in Ramniwas garden where people forcibly entered the venue. Several people jumped over the barricades before police managed to stop them. Surprise choice The BJP on December 12 picked first-time MLA Bhajan Lal Sharma as Rajasthan's new Chief Minister, ending days of speculation that followed its victory in the assembly polls.

The changes are set to be rolled out across the next few weeks and may differ based on the user’s region. (For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today’s Cache) Android TV users can watch or buy/rent new movies through the Shop tab’s ‘Your Library’ row. Those using cable boxes or set-top boxes powered by Android TV will be able to access content through the YouTube app. The same condition applies to web browser users. Previously bought titles or active rented ones will remain available on Android TV devices, Google TV devices, the Google TV mobile app for both Android and iOS, and YouTube. Most of these changes are scheduled to come into force from January 17 next year.

            "content": "Stock brokerage startup Zerodha stands as one of the largest online brokerage firms in the country, co-founded by Nithin Kamath and his brother Nikhil Kamath, along with five others. According to their company's filings with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Nithin Kamath and Nikhil Kamath drew in an annual salary of ₹72 crore each in Financial Year 2023 (FY23). In the financial year 2022, Zerodha reported a substantial gross profit of ₹2,094 crores and an increased revenue of ₹4,964 crores. Nithin Kamath is among the youngest billionaires of the country and is ready to challenge Mukesh Ambani. Despite currently earning crores monthly, Nithin's journey started at a call center with a modest salary of Rs 8,000 per month. Zerodha's success is notable in India's unicorn boom, being a bootstrapped and highly profitable company. Nithin Kamath began trading stocks at the age of 17 while working at a call center. His entrepreneurial journey took off when he managed an NRI's account he met at the gym, becoming his first client. Inspired by the opportunity, Kamath left his job and founded Zerodha. Having worked for 12 brokerage firms, Kamath identified a gap in the market and established Zerodha to bring online brokerage services. The company initially struggled but gained visibility after being featured in an Economic Times article in 2011. Zerodha's business model emphasises low margin and high volume, offering zero charges for equity delivery investments and a flat fee for other trades. Despite the corporate trend of hiring from prestigious institutions like IITs and IIMs, Kamath has not hired anyone from these backgrounds, citing a mismatch in fitting them within Zerodha's culture. He values individuals who prioritise organisational growth over personal career advancement. Kamath believes in the importance of doing things differently and emphasizes that quick success is a rare occurrence in life.",

            "content": "The Eidgah mosque committee had moved the Supreme Court against the High Court’s order on survey of Mosque complex, alleging that it was illegal and arbitrary. New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday declined to stay the Allahabad High Court’s order for appointing a court commissioner to conduct a survey of the Shahi Eidgah mosque complex in Mathura, which is claimed by some Hindu groups as the birthplace of Lord Krishna. The Eidgah mosque committee had moved the Supreme Court against the High Court’s order, alleging that it was illegal and arbitrary. The lawyer for the mosque committee, Huzefa Ahmadi, argued that the Supreme Court had already admitted their petition challenging the transfer of all the cases related to the dispute to the Allahabad High Court. He said that the Supreme Court had asked for written arguments on their petition and had said that it required a detailed hearing. He said that the matter was still pending in the Supreme Court, but the High Court had passed an order for the survey, which would prejudice the outcome of the case. The Supreme Court bench, headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana, said that the petition against the transfer of the cases was listed for hearing on January 9th. The bench said that it would hear the matter on that day and that the mosque committee had not formally challenged the High Court’s order of yesterday. The bench said that it could not pass any interim order at this stage. Ahmadi urged the Supreme Court to intervene, saying that the High Court was going to pass an order on finalizing the outline of the survey on December 18th. He said that the Supreme Court’s intervention was necessary to protect the rights of the mosque committee. The Supreme Court said that the mosque committee could inform the High Court that the Supreme Court was going to hear the dispute on January 9th. The Supreme Court also said that the mosque committee could tell the High Court about its observations made today. Ahmadi said that they had informed the High Court about the pending hearing in the Supreme Court, but the High Court did not pay heed to them. He said that after today, the Supreme Court would be closed for the winter vacation and that if the High Court passed any order further, it would not be possible to challenge it in the Supreme Court immediately. The Supreme Court said that it was not intervening right now and that if the High Court’s order went against the mosque committee, they could challenge it in the Supreme Court.",
